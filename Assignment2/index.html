                <h2>Chippiparais</h2>
                <p>
                    Chippiparais are sight hounds, and have eyes positioned in such a way as to give them a 270 degree scope of vision – much more than most other breeds.  But the first thing you’ll notice is how skinny they are. Worry not, they have not been starved! Most of their weight is from their muscles and bones, and not from body fat.

                <h2>Rajapalayam</h2>
                <p>
                    This first thing that you would notice in your Rajapalayam is their milky white coat that is almost a standard for the breed. This is one of those few breeds who do not come in a multiple colors but a standard white only coat.   This breed has a characteristic pink nose and skin, which is absolutely different when compared to other dogs around the world. This many say can be attributed to the albino effect in your dog
